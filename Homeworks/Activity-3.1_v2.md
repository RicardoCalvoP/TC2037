## Exercises:

1. Give a recursive definition of the set of strings over $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$ that have at least one $a$, and where any $b$ must be followed by an $a$.
For example: $a$, $aaaaa$ and $aabaaaba$ belong to the set, but $bab$, $ababba$ no not belong in the set

    _**SOLUTION:**_


0. Let $X = \{aa, bb\}$ and $Y = \{\lambda, b, ab\}$.

    a. List the strings in set $XY$

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|------|-|------|-|------
    1|rrr   |2|rrr   |3|rrr

    b. How many strings of length 6 are there in $X^*$?


    c. List the strings in set $Y^*$ of length three or less

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|------|-|------|-|------
    1|rrr   |2|rrr   |3|rrr
    

    d. List the strings in set $X^* Y^*$ of length four or less

    #|string|#|string|#|string
    -|------|-|------|-|------
    1|rrr   |2|rrr   |3|rrr



0. Give a recursive definition of the set $\{ b^ia^j | 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 2i\}$
For example: $ba$, $bbaaa$ and $bbaaaa$ belong to this set.

    _**SOLUTION:**_



0. Let $L$ be the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ generated by the recursive
   definition

    **I. Basis:** $b \in L$

    **II. Recursive Step**: If $u \in L$ then $ub \in L$, $uab \in L$, $uba \in
    L$ and $bua \in L$

    **III. Closure**: A string $u \in L$ only if it can be obtained from the
    basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step.

    Answer the following questions:

    **a.** List the elements in the sets $L_0, L_1, L_2$


    **b.** Is the string $bbaaba$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced.
    If not, explain why not.


    **c.** Is the string $bbbaabb$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is produced.
    If not, explain why not


0. Prove, using induction on the length of a string, that $(w^R)^R = w$ for all
   string $w \in \Sigma$

    _**SOLUTION:**_
