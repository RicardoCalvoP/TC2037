# Analisis of languages

Ricardo Calvo - A01028889
### Description
In this assigment we are going to evaluate the programming languages we know, from the article provided in class _"These Modern Programming Languages Will Make You Suffer"_

---

**Evaluation table**

The evaulation will be graded in base of 10

|Language | Raiting |
|---------|---------|
|C++      |3 / 10   |
|Python   |6.5 / 10 |

### C++

**Pros**

From my experience with C++, I think one of the pros of learning it is the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), since it can be considered "easy" to learn (depending on the professor).

Also, it's an option in case you want to do database analysis, savings, etc.

**Cons**

As the article says, C++ compiler error messages are not clear enough, which will give you a hard time programming.

Also, since it hasn't received recent big feature updates, it's pretty much obsolete for new technologies.

**Conclusion**

I would only recommend using C++ for learning OOP, small coding projects, Data Projects, or if the company you are working with is using C++ (although I would recommend other languages for bigger projects).

### Python

**Pros**

Python has many libraries you can work with to make you projects easier.

Since this language is considerably young, and it´s one of the most popular, it has constant updates and new releases with more libraries and shortcuts.

You can do bascicly any project you want no matter if it´s small or big project, even though I would consider Python for bigger projects.

**Cons**

The only cons I can think of is that since there is so many libraries, you would never stop learning what library is better than the other, and all the functions they have, also, having many libraries in one project can harm the performance.

**Conclusion**

I would use Python in basicly any project i need to do, since easy to learn, can use libraries, and is very inferable to work.

### Languages I would like to learn

Some of the languages that I want to learn are Java and JavaScript. I think the main reason is that these languages are popular, and many companies ask for people who know how to use these programming languages.

I think these are two basic languages you need to learn, just like C++.

### Conclusion

No matter what language you start with, it has its own beauty, but it's very important to keep learning new languages and skills. Since the tech industry is always changing, sticking with just one language will not work for long.

Also, the more languages you know, the easier it will be to learn new programming languages, since you understand the structure, and new languages most of the time are just new syntax and other uses.
